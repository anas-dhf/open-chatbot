Concept: A personal Terminal-based Assistant running with Google Gemini. 

Before anything, please visit this page: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key
Get your API Key and insert it into the source.py file. 
You will find a spot where to put it in the first line of code.

Before running the file, please do run the following command in the terminal:

**$ pip install langchain_google_genai**

If there was an error on Linux, make sure you have Python installed.
If the error persisted write the following command:

**$ pip install langchain_google_genai --break-system-packages**

If you're on windows and encounter a problem of unrecognized command, make sure you include Python in the Environment Variables (Path).

Take full responsibilities for the actions you do.
